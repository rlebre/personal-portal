As a computer and software engineer, I spend a lot of my time during the day behind my screens. I constantly try to get out and stay in contact with nature and the environment. During working days, unless abnormal event, I do not exempt from daily exercise. Whether it be walking, cycling, swimming, or just a little bit of gym classes.

When the weekend approaches, I start doing my plans to go hiking in the mountain, surf, spend time with my family, or just relax. Honestly, often relaxing is replaced by learning new things related to software engineering (mostly frontend) or just learning a new language (german). In fact, I really enjoy learning new things, which makes it also a hobby for me.

In this section, I show some pictures from my other hobby: photography. Hope you enjoyed to know a bit more about me!
